Shooting raw video refers to capturing video in its raw, unprocessed form directly from the camera\u0026rsquo;s image sensor. This allows for more flexible post-production editing and color correction since the data is not compressed or processed. Raw video files are often much larger than standard video files, but provide higher image quality and greater color depth. The benefit of shooting raw video is that it allows for greater creative control and the ability to make adjustments without losing image quality.","tags":["Tips","RawVideoShootMagicLantern"],"title":"Shooting RAW video with Magic Lantern - Which camera to buy?","type":"post","url":"/labveiltech/2023/01/29/magic-lantern-raw-video-current-camera-capabilities/","weight":0,"wordcount":430},{"author":null,"categories":["Tips"],"content":"Canon 5D Mark III capable of 4K all along","date":1674903600,"description":"Canon 5D Mark III capable of 4K all along","dir":"post/","excerpt_html":"Canon 5D Mark III capable of 4K all along","excerpt_text":"Canon 5D Mark III capable of 4K all along","expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":400,"html":"Canon 5D Mark III capable of 4K all along","keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1674903600,"objectID":"5c97df66fa3f9ea09382331f57a145e5","permalink":"https://sylvainsalgatheig.github.io/labveiltech/2023/01/28/canon-5d-mark-iii-4k-capable/","publishdate":"2023-01-28T11:00:00Z","readingtime":2,"relpermalink":"/labveiltech/2023/01/28/canon-5d-mark-iii-4k-capable/","section":"post","summary":"Why is this article important for me?
