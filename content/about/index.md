## About Me
**_Sylvain Salgat_** Computer hardware and multimedia computer scientist in the process of updating into an audiovisual producer. Swiss Army knife of digital, multidisciplinary and disciplined. Spell checker on legs, apprentice editor.

During my free time, you can find myself running, drumming or fixing computers. Also trying new vegan recipes and probably failing miserably. But I'll eventually get there!
