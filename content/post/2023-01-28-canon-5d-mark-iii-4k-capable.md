## Why is this article important for me?
As someone who's passionate about hardware and pushing it to it's limits, I've always hated software limitations. This behaviour from big tech companies has always been very popular, but luckily, devoted modders are always there to save our products from being thrown away. That's what happened to the Canon 5D Mark III camera, which thanks to the Magic Lantern mod, shows that it was always able to shoot 4K video.

## What's the article about?
This article is about a camera mod for Canon cameras, which is known as Magic Lantern. The author, Andrew Reid of EOSHD, explains that the 5D Mark III has been capable of 4K and 3.5K video recording since 2012, but Canon chose to lock this feature and never allow it for the end user. With the new Magic Lantern build, the camera now has access to a 4K mode. But more importantly, it can now do 3.5K 10-bit lossless raw mode with Super 35mm continuous recording, making it a viable option for filmmakers. The 3.5K mode offers a lower-resolution, lower-fps preview of the scene for accurate framing, which is a big advantage over the 4K mode. The article concludes by saying that the 10-bit 3.5K mode is the sweet spot for the 5D Mark III, offering the best image quality and raw capabilities for the lowest cost.

## What am I going to do with this information?
Before buying myself a new camera, I'll have to look beyond the official specsheet to check what Magic Lantern is capable of. Buying a used Canon camera might become a way better deal than a brand new one, with the same capabilities. I'll save this article in my Firefox bookmarks, and open it again once I'll have enough money saved to consider buying a used 5D Mark III.
