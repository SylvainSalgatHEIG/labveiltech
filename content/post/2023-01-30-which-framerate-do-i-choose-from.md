## Why is this article important for me?
Shooting raw video refers to capturing video in its raw, unprocessed form directly from the camera's image sensor. This allows for more flexible post-production editing and color correction since the data is not compressed or processed. Raw video files are often much larger than standard video files, but provide higher image quality and greater color depth. The benefit of shooting raw video is that it allows for greater creative control and the ability to make adjustments without losing image quality.

The Magic Lantern mod allows some Canon cameras to shoot raw video, depending on the models. The more expensive isn't necessarily the better, and that's why this article is really interesting.




## What's the article about?
The article "Beginner's Guide to Frame Rates for Every Type of Video" by Komal from InVideo is a comprehensive guide for individuals who are new to video editing. The article explains the importance of frame rates or frames per second (fps) in determining the quality of a video and the viewing experience for the audience.

The article covers the following topics:

    Explanation of what a frame rate is and why it's important.
    The effects of shooting and editing videos at different frame rates.
    How to choose the best frame rate for a video.

The article explains that the frame rate refers to the speed at which still images in a video move and that a higher frame rate results in smoother video quality. The standard frame rate for video production is 24fps, as it was set in the 1970s for its balance of sound reproduction and visual experience without wasting film.

The article also highlights the benefits of shooting videos at higher frame rates such as 60fps or 120fps, which results in more detailed and crisp footage. However, it's important to consider the purpose of the video and the audience when choosing the best frame rate.

In conclusion, the article provides a comprehensive guide for individuals who are new to video editing and provides valuable information on frame rates. As a result, you have decided to store the link in your browser favorites to use as a reference in the future.
