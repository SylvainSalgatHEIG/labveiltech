## Why is this article important for me?
Shooting raw video refers to capturing video in its raw, unprocessed form directly from the camera's image sensor. This allows for more flexible post-production editing and color correction since the data is not compressed or processed. Raw video files are often much larger than standard video files, but provide higher image quality and greater color depth. The benefit of shooting raw video is that it allows for greater creative control and the ability to make adjustments without losing image quality.

The Magic Lantern mod allows some Canon cameras to shoot raw video, depending on the models. The more expensive isn't necessarily the better, and that's why this article is really interesting.




## What's the article about?
This article is about the different classes of Canon cameras for raw video and their capabilities. The author, Andrew Reid, has put together the information based on his personal experience and the use of a raw calculator tool. The main factor in determining the resolution of a camera is the speed at which it can write data to the card. Magic Lantern has implemented 12-bit and 10-bit raw recording, which decreases the data rate and acts as compression.

There are three performance classes of Canon cameras for raw video: fast cameras, mid-range cameras, and slow cameras. The 5D Mark III is the most capable for raw video, but also the most expensive. The 7D is the best value for money, and the 70D is unique in having Dual Pixel AF and an articulated screen. The 700D and 100D/SL1 are the best cheap cameras.

The article also provides information on the maximum recording resolutions and crop factors for each camera. The buffer size for recording raw images ranges from 100MB to 275MB. Regardless of the camera's writing speed, a few seconds of raw video can be recorded in the buffer memory before it fills up. However, the card must keep up with the size of the recording, otherwise, the camera will stop. The maximum resolutions for continuous raw recording are listed for each camera.



## What am I going to do with this information?
This article is a comprehensive guide to the different classes of Canon cameras for raw video and their capabilities. The information provided will help me choose the right camera for my needs and understand the limitations of each camera. I'll save this article in my Firefox bookmarks, and open it again when I find a good deal on a used Canon camera, to see if it meets the requirements to shoot raw video for enough time.
