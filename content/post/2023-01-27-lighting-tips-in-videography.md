## Why is this article important for me?
As a filmmaker or videographer, one of the most important things to consider when creating a video is lighting. Lighting is crucial in setting the mood and atmosphere of the video and can greatly impact how viewers perceive the scene and the subject. In this article, the author discuss why lighting is so important in videos and how it can be used to enhance a scene and create the desired mood and atmosphere.

## What's the article about?
One of the most commonly used techniques in video production is three point lighting. This technique involves using three main types of lighting: key lighting, fill lighting, and back lighting. Key lighting focuses on the main subject in the scene, fill lighting is used to eliminate shadows, and back lighting provides contrast between the subject and the environment. By using these three lighting techniques, the main subject can be properly illuminated and highlighted, which helps to draw the viewer's attention to the subject.

* Key lighting is the most direct source of light in a scene, and it is usually installed first. The key light is usually placed on the side of the camera that the main subject is facing, and the angle and height of the light can be adjusted to change the mood and look of the entire scene.

* Fill lighting is used to eliminate shadows and to illuminate areas that are in the dark. When placing fill lights, it is important to ensure that they are not too strong or too light, as this can create its own shadows or fail to properly fill the shadowed areas.

* Back lighting is placed behind the main subject and is used to make the subject stand out from the environment and background. The back light illuminates the silhouette of the subject, which helps to create contrast and draw the viewer's attention directly to the subject. Dimmers can be used to control the back lighting, and filters and neutral density gels can be used to reduce the light if necessary.

When shooting outdoors, natural lighting can often be the best type of lighting, especially during the mid-morning to afternoon hours. The sun can be used as back lighting and can provide a nice glow around the subject. However, sometimes artificial lighting may need to be used, especially if the scene cannot be shot at the ideal time of day for the best lighting.

## What am I going to do with this information?
Lighting is such an important part of filmmaking; it's literally the main aspect that separates amateur videos from professional ones. Therefore, I'll save this article in my Firefox bookmarks, and open it the day before every video shoot, to make sure that I didn't forget anything.
